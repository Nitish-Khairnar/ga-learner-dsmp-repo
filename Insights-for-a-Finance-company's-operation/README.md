### Project Overview

 Here we are helping the stakeholders of Dream Housing Finance company to help them get visual insights on the company's operations. Using the data visualization techniques we can help the stakeholders arrive at some inference based on the visual plots.


### Learnings from the project

 The following key concepts I have learned 
Bar plotting
Scatter plotting
Kernel Density plotting
Subplot operations
Axes modifications


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Everytime a problem was thrown at me, I segreagted the data we wanted to by using a groupby function and then I tried finding out the relation between two data points


### Challenges faced

 First thing was that I was new to visualisation and hence there were lot of syntax errors. Using various platforms like stack and medium I quickly learnt how to visualise the data effectively


### Additional pointers

 Thebasic guidelines are good principles to think and implement whenever we are trying to create visualizations in our role as a data scientist. With this, we are ready to go forward in the next step of the journey as a data scientist.
