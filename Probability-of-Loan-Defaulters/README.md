### Project Overview

 We have a dataset from LendingClub.com. Just to give a bried intro of LendingClub, it is a club which connects people who need money(borrowers) to the people who have money for lending purpose(investors). Now as a investor one would invest in those people who have high probability of paying back the amount borrowed.


### Learnings from the project

 I got a better understanding of how probability calculations works in real life scenario. The following concepts got cleared:
1- Independency check
2-Bayes theorem
3- Visualizing discrete variable
4- Visualizing continous variable


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I first had a look in detailed over our data. Then I checked for Independent events, for that we had to calculate the conditional probability of those events and check if its the same or not. Then using the Bayes theorem, I calculated the probability of credit policy and loan given.
I then visualized the data using bar plot and histogram


### Challenges faced

 I had a intuitive knowledge of Probability, but how to code it in python was new to me. So I took the help of external sources and learned how to do calculations in Python and successfully completed the project.


### Additional pointers

 Before directly jumping onto bayes theorem, we need to find out the independent events, only then we will get the probability correctly predicted.
