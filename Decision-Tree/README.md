### Project Overview

 For this project I will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back

The data that we have is from 2007-2010.

Our aim is using Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model. In this project,  I have applied the following concepts.

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Decision Tree Modeling
Evaluation Metrics
Graphviz plotting


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 As usual, I followed the basic steps like data cleaning and EDA. This steps gives us a very clear idea as to how our data looks like.Then I split the features using IG and Gini Index. I visualised it and found to be a good split. Then I built the DT model and regularised it to avoid overfitting.


### Challenges faced

 The Graphviz plotting was a challenge for me, it is a new concept and I struggled in coding. I took the help from Stack Overflow and Github for recitfying.


### Additional pointers

 Try different splitting criteria for various features before finalizing one. Most importantly the splitting decision is domain knowledge based so have a thorough study of the case study.
Use visualization technique as far as possible as it gives us a good idea whether we are heading in right way or not.
