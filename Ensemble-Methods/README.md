### Project Overview

 This dataset was generated using HRSC nadir panchromatic image h0905_0000 taken by the Mars Express spacecraft. The images is located in the Xanthe Terra, centered on Nanedi Vallis and covers mostly Noachian terrain on Mars. The image had a resolution of 12.5 meters/pixel.
We have to determine if the instance is crater or not a crater


### Learnings from the project

 1- How to read an Image with the help of Matplot Library of python and how to convert it to a numpy array.
2- Preprocess the data, and the build the model and predict the values after building a machine learning model.
3- Build a Decision Tree model and try improving the accuracy with help of Random Forest, Aggregation methods like Boostrap Aggregating and Voting classifier


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Converting an image to array was a new concept for me, I had to go through a lot of materials from web about it. After it was converted to array, I did the basic approach of machine learning model building. 
As I have newly learnt about the Decision Trees, I tried improving the accuracy of my model with various method like aggregation and Random Forest classifier.


### Challenges faced

 The dataset is from a completely new domain field. Its the images of mars taken by Mars Express Spacecraft, and through this we have to determine if the instance is crater or not. So firstly I has to find out what exactly the data is trying to convey, what are the different terminologies that are used here.

Then Image conversion to array was a new concept for me, it is complex task and needs to be understand thoroughly. I went through some articles from the web where they have explaiend it in layman's terms.


### Additional pointers

 Understanding the problem statement from the stake holder point of view and through that particular domain expertise is important before building our machine leanrin models.
