### Project Overview

 We have a dataset of 500 super heroes and suoer villains from the 'Academy of Super Beings (ASB)'. With the help of Descriptive Stats, lets find out some insights. The data has 594 super hero characters with 17 features.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better grip on the applications of descriptive statistics. In this project, I learnt the following concepts :
Bar plotting
Boxplot plotting
Pie-chart plotting
Subplot operations
Feature Correlation
IQR operations


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I discovered various libraries and functions of python which helps us to avoid the complex calculations of stats. By using simple coding functions we can easily calculate the mean, std deviation, covariance, correaltion, etc.


### Challenges faced

 Visualization of this stats was a little confusing for me. I took the help of external resources like GeekforGeeks, Stackoverflow to overcome it.


### Additional pointers

 Descriptive stats helps us to know our data in a much better way. As EDA forms a very fundamental of any machine learning model, descriptive stats helps us in cleaning and preparing our data so that we can build a model on it.
