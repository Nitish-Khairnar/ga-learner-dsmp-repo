### Project Overview

 We are given references to news pages collected from an web aggregator for a specific period. The resources are grouped into categories that represent pages discussing the same story. News categories included in this dataset include business(b); science and technology(t); entertainment(e); and health(h).


### Learnings from the project

 1-Preprocessing  text data with tokenization, stopword removal etc
2-Vectorizing data using Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches
3-Applying classifiers (Logistic and Multinomial Naive Bayes) to perform multi-class classification


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used the text analytics like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization for segregating the data.
I tried vectorizing the data with bag of words and TF-IDF approach, and compared the results.
For multi class classification, I also used the Logistics and Multinomial Naive Bayes techniques


### Challenges faced

 The dataset was quite big and extracting the main features was a challenge. Going back to Data Wrangling techniques helped me to identify the main attributes.


### Additional pointers

 I would suggest that we do need to have a domain expertise of the rekevant field so that deciding the no of models is easy.
