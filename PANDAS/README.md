### Project Overview

 Here we are doing an comprehensive anaylsis for a finance company which specialises itself in home loans across various market segments-rural, ,semi-urban, and urban.Thier loan eligibility process is based on customer details provided while filling an online application form.


### Learnings from the project

 I have learnt DataFrame slicing and aggregation and also Pivot table operations to some extent.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 First I have summarized the data in proper rows and columns which makes it easy to read. Then according to the problem we have at times dropped specific columsn, filled the NaN values and done various data slicing.


### Challenges faced

 For me, the challenging part was to arrive at the result in pythonic way, For the problems given, I was able to decode the logic, but to express it in programming langauge was little tough for me.


### Additional pointers

 We must keep on solving such problems which helps us in understanding the vast functionalities of the Pandas.
